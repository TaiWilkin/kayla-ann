	<h1>Kayla Ann Colgan</h1>
	<p><strong>Jenny Wilkin, 12/02/16: </strong>"Our beautiful granddaughter was born on Wednesday night. 5 lbs, 9 oz. and 19 inches long. November is now even fuller with birthdays! We haven't been able to meet her yet as she was in the NICU because of a severe cleft palate and cleft lip. Other than being unable to suck from a bottle, she is doing well. Now she can be with her mom and dad between feedings. Our prayers are with our beautiful Kayla Ann Colgan and her whole family. I can't wait to meet her on Sunday."</p>
